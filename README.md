# Infusion Angular2 .NETCore Starter project using VS Code

This repository contains a VS Code starter project for Angular2 and .NET Core. It is intended to lower the barrier for people to get started with Angular2 development on top of .NET Core. Using this starter, you will be able to rapidly develop Angular2 apps and seemlessly deploy them to Azure or run them standalone using Kestrel.  

# Get going

Follow these five easy steps to get going:

1. Install .NET Core 1.1. You can find it at https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core
2. Install Visual Studio Code. You can find it at https://code.visualstudio.com/Download (this will also give you node)
3. Update Node.js and npm to reasonable versions. Easiest is to simple re-install the latest LTS from https://nodejs.org/en/. 
4. Clone this repo locally. 
5. Open the folder containing the repo with VS Code. Press Ctrl-Shift-D to get into the debugger. Clike on the green launch arrow to build, start the Kestrel server (localhost:5000) and launch Chrome in private mode connecting to server. 

You should see something like this:
